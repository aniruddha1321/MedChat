## MedChat
MedChat is a user-friendly medical chatbot designed to provide informative and engaging interactions for patients seeking healthcare guidance. Built with Python, it seamlessly integrates a powerful combination of cutting-edge technologies:
* **LangChain**: This robust natural language processing (NLP) library empowers MedChat to understand and respond to user queries in a comprehensive and contextually aware manner.
* **Chainlit**: By incorporating Chainlink, MedChat can potentially connect to external healthcare data sources (subject to authorization and data privacy regulations) to retrieve up-to-date medical information, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of its responses.
* **Faiss**: This efficient similarity search library optimizes the retrieval process, allowing MedChat to quickly identify the most relevant responses to user inquiries from its knowledge base.
* **Torch**: As a cornerstone deep learning framework, Torch provides the foundation for training and deploying the machine learning models that underpin MedChat's capabilities.
* **Sentence Transformers**: These pre-trained models, adept at capturing semantic relationships between words and sentences, form the core of MedChat's natural language understanding. By fine-tuning them on medical domain-specific data, MedChat can effectively grasp the nuances of medical language.
* **Streamlit**: This user-friendly web framework facilitates the creation of a visually appealing and interactive interface for MedChat, ensuring a seamless user experience.
